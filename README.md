## How to setup a development environment

### SaSS
- Install SaSS (`npm install --global saas`)
- cd to project directory
- run `sass --watch assets/css/apps/mail/cmps/sass:assets/css/apps/mail/cmps`
- NOTE: Run `sass` before pushing to master. Later should configure GitHub Pages to automate this process.
